Our dashboard provides the answer by finding locations in Vancouverthat align with your commute preferences and then compare these locations based on their affordability & pricing. This could form the basis for real-estate platforms to factor in commute times when looking for new places to rent, buy or live.

Implemented in `Leaflet`, `D3.js` and `ReactJS`.
